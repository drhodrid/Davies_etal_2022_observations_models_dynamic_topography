# Davies_etal_2022_observations_models_dynamic_topography
Datasets associated with: Davies, D. R, S. Ghelichkhan, M. J. Hoggard, A. P. Valentine and F. D. Richards (2022) -- Observations and models of dynamic topography: Current status and future directions, in Dynamics of plate tectonics and mantle convection} (Ed: J. C. Duarte).

There are two folders:
1. dynamic_topography_predictions: includes datafiles associated with model predictions of dynamic topography for the 3 cases presented in Fig. 4 of the paper (lon, lat, value). We include the full dataset, in addition to the dataset sampled at spot and shiptrack locations. For the latter, the first 2030 points correspond to the spot locations. 
2. geoid_predictions: includes datafiles associated with model predictions of geoid height anomalies for the 3 cases presented in Fig. 4 of the paper (lon, lat, value).

We are happy to add additional datafiles, as requested.
